# Monoped Creature Repo
I took most of my inspiration from whales. I like their overall shape, and I thought it would be cool to mix it with some sort of mythical creature, so naturally my mind went to a dragon!
I wanted a sleeker design to the creature, so the horns are pretty simple and the body shape is fairly rounded. On the sides of the head are tube like horn protrusions, and along the back
there is a dorsal fin. I wanted it to "feel" aquatic in the design, and I feel like I achieved that. 

During the retopo phase, I'd say the biggest challenge I ran into was getting good edge flow around areas like the eyes and the nose. I feel good about the point I was able to get to 
with the topology, although I know it isn't perfect. I think at this point, before bringing it back into Zbrush, I kept the form pretty well and the expressiveness around the eyes of 
the creature. Overall, pretty happy with the progress so far.

At this point, bringing the model back and forth from Zbrush and Maya went really well! I was able to keep the details I wanted and fix some areas that needed some work. I feel like the
look of the creature is what I envisioned it to be, and it was a great learning process to use Zbrush and work with the model itself in maya.

Having all the UVs and textures done, it's clear to see the areas in which I feel like I succeeded and the areas I struggled in. I feel like the overall personality and character of my monoped
was maintained, and I'm happy with how the overall look turned out. I wanted to be able to produce some sort of translucent back fin, but couldn't get it to a place that I felt great about. UV
mapping the model was a simple process, but making sure that the overall topology of the mesh was good was a bit more of a challenge. Overall, happy with how it turned out and definitely have some
notes on areas of improvement for future projects.

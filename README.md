# Monoped Creature Repo
I took most of my inspiration from whales. I like their overall shape, and I thought it would be cool to mix it with some sort of mythical creature, so naturally my mind went to a dragon!
I wanted a sleeker design to the creature, so the horns are pretty simple and the body shape is fairly rounded. On the sides of the head are tube like horn protrusions, and along the back
there is a dorsal fin. I wanted it to "feel" aquatic in the design, and I feel like I achieved that. 

During the retopo phase, I'd say the biggest challenge I ran into was getting good edge flow around areas like the eyes and the nose. I feel good about the point I was able to get to 
with the topology, although I know it isn't perfect. I think at this point, before bringing it back into Zbrush, I kept the form pretty well and the expressiveness around the eyes of 
the creature. Overall, pretty happy with the progress so far.
